Hard-Coding a Network
- Part 1
- Explained the procedure and derived the weights and bias
- Explanation can be found in the pdf named **solution4a_4b**
- Part 2
- I have drawn the smaller computational graphs and I have then drawn the over all computational graph
- I have found the derivatives using chain rule
- Everything can be found in **solution4a_4b**
